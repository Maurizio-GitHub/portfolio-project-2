# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?

This is a very simple website, built to engage users with an enjoyable pastime: 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?', the game invented by Sam Kass in 1998 that recently became super popular thanks to 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series!

The site mainly targets people who typically are casual or regular pastime-consumers, like the ones who enjoy spending a few hours a week with solitaires and other similar games.

## Features

<br>

- Simple header with a call to action

    - It welcomes the players with a neat sentence, immediately inviting them to act on the buttons (with visual feedback on hover) below it in order to start a new game:
    ![Buttons](/assets/media/buttons.png "Buttons")

<br>

- Game area with scores and feedback messages

    - Before a new game starts, this area provides players with a nice couple of pictures depicting the game rules. They just differ in their colours, in relation to player-side and computer-side respectively:
    ![Game Rules](/assets/media/images-area.png "Game Rules")
    - Once the game is running, pictures change to reflect player and computer choices, scores get updated based on game rules, moves left decrement accordingly and a feedback message appear to the bottom to clearly state who scored (i.e. who won):
    ![Game Area](/assets/media/game-area.png "Game Area")
    - After the 9 regular moves - if you got there - since it always depends on the total scores made during the game (whose winner must score 5 out of 9), in case of a draw (of course, regardless that the very last move ends up with a "Draw!" - as in the case depicted below - or not), a tie-break phase starts. Just next to the counter saying that there are no moves left, a very clear feedback message says that. This phase goes on, possibly through other draws, until one of the opponents scores and the game over condition is met with a clear winner:
    ![Tie-Break](/assets/media/tie-break.png "Tie-Break")
    - When the game over condition is finally met, a final message clearly stating who won the game is shown. The moves-buttons disappear and a restart button pops up (also this one with feedback on hover) to invite players to enter a new game:
    ![Game Over](/assets/media/game-over.png "Game Over")

## Testing

<br>

- The website was successfully tested on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- The website is responsive and looks good on different devices. Its functioning was successfully tested on all standard screen sizes by using Chrome DevTools as well as [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
- I confirmed that any single piece of text is readable, easy to understand and fully accessible.
- I confirmed that the whole Javascript logic addressing the game rules and every possible outcome properly works.

## Bugs

<br>

- Fixed bugs

    - There were some logic issues in properly handling the tie-break phase. Everything was fixed and retest after reviewing a few lines of JS code. Relevant comments have also been added to the code for reference.

<br>

- Unfixed bugs

    - No bugs at this writing.

<br>

- Future developments

    - Since it is just a simple game, with no need to capture user choices, any impression of 'overengineering' has been averted. Yet, it could still make sense to move the comparison logic used in the checkWinner() function in a data structure, i.e. via an array of dictionaries, with each element representing everything we need to know about a specific move.
