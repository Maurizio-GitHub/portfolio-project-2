# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?

This is a very simple website, built to engage users with an enjoyable pastime: 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?', the game invented by Sam Kass in 1998 that recently became super popular thanks to 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series!

The site mainly targets people who typically are casual or regular pastime-consumers, like the ones who enjoy spending a few hours a week with solitaires and other similar games.

## Features

<br>

- Navigation menu

    - Featured on every page, a responsive navigation menu includes links to the website Home page, Milestones, Digital Art and Newsletter page. It is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation: users can surf from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the 'back' button. Each page-link is accompanied by an elegant icon conceptually representing the section it refers to:

<br>

- Digital Art page

    - This section was added to introduce newbies and content creators to the real revolution taking place in the world of digital art thanks to NFTs. Complex, yet easily explained concepts, accompanied by a brief historical excursus, are followed by curiosities and upheavals in the world of art. In addition, the much talked about artwork of Beeple is shown, with a direct, external link to the mind-boggling auction ended on March 11, 2021:

## Testing

<br>

- The website was successfully tested on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- The website is responsive and looks good on different devices. Its functioning was successfully tested on all standard screen sizes by using Chrome DevTools as well as [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
- I confirmed that any single navigation element and piece of text is readable, easy to understand and fully accessible.
- I confirmed that the subscription form properly works. It requires entries on every field, will only accept an email in the relevant field and the 'Join' button does exactly what it was designed to do.

## Bugs

<br>

- Fixed bugs

    - The home page, at the very beginning, had not been built with a mobile-first approach. This resulted in a poor mobile experience, net of the necessary media queries added. Therefore, by changing approach, the code became easier to (re)write and the page much better to look at.

<br>

- Unfixed bugs

    - There is a weird rendering issue affecting Title and Navigation Menu on some 2018 Apple devices (iPhone XS Max and MacBook Air), whose root cause has not been possible to identify yet, either via searching for it on tech forums or via YouTube. No compatibility issues seem to be involved with respect to the code used.

<br>

- Future developments

    - Home page is not 4K-optimized, as current choices of hero image and textual contents do not provide the same immersive experience they have for lower resolutions. Future developments will address this by looking for more advanced media contents and the addition of some extra information.
